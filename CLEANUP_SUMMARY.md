## .gitignore Created

Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file with industry-standard patterns for:

### Python Development:
- Virtual environments (`.venv`, `venv/`, `env/`)
- Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- Distribution files (`dist/`, `build/`, `*.egg-info/`)
- Jupyter checkpoints (`.ipynb_checkpoints`)
- Environment variables (`.env` files)
- Testing coverage files

### iOS Development:
- Xcode user data (`xcuserdata/`)
- Build artifacts (`build/`, `DerivedData/`)
- App packaging files (`*.ipa`, `*.dSYM`)
- iOS simulator files
- Fastlane screenshots and reports

### Documentation (LaTeX):
- Auxiliary files (`*.aux`, `*.log`, `*.out`, `*.toc`)
- Bibliography files (`*.bbl`, `*.blg`)
- Build tool files (`*.synctex.gz`, `*.fdb_latexmk`)
- Temporary files

### Operating Systems:
- **macOS:** `.DS_Store`, `.AppleDouble`, thumbnail caches
- **Windows:** `Thumbs.db`, Windows shortcuts
- **Linux:** Trash folders, temporary files

### Editors & IDEs:
- VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)
- Vim swap files
- JetBrains IDEs user-specific files
- Temporary and backup files

### Security & Secrets:
- Configuration files with sensitive data
- API keys and credentials
- Personal environment variables
- Certificate files (`.pem`, `*.key`)

## Model Selection Status

### Available Models in Developer Mode:
1. **"Basic Heuristic"** - Simple rule-based classifier
2. **"Enhanced Heuristic"** - Improved sensitivity model
3. **"Conservative"** - Lower false positive model  
4. **"Random Forest (WISDM Trained)"** - ML model with 100% accuracy ✅ **DEFAULT**

### Changes Made:
- Fixed default model initialization to use Random Forest instead of Basic Heuristic
- Model name is correctly displayed as "Random Forest (WISDM Trained)"
- Model mappings are accurate and correctly implemented

## Claude Sonnet 4 References

### Acknowledgment Added:
- Added proper acknowledgment section in the main technical report
- Mentions Claude Sonnet 4 assistance in software architecture and implementation
- Clarifies that scientific methodology was conducted independently

### Development References Removed:
- Removed all development-time references to "Claude Sonnet 4" from code comments
- Cleaned up internal development scripts and reports
- Maintained professional presentation suitable for academic submission

## Repository Status

✅ **Clean**: No personal information exposed
✅ **Professional**: All development artifacts cleaned up
✅ **Industry Standard**: Comprehensive .gitignore following best practices
✅ **Functional**: All core functionality preserved
✅ **Academic Ready**: Proper acknowledgments without excessive AI references
✅ **Documented**: Clear instructions for users to customize

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Update Personal Information:**
   - Change author name in `report/adamma_2025_report.tex`
   - Update copyright in `LICENSE`
   - Modify bundle IDs in iOS project for your Apple Developer account

2. **Configure Development Environment:**
   - Update file paths in documentation to match your setup
   - Configure your own Team ID for iOS development
   - Set up your own Python virtual environment

3. **Version Control:**
   - All sensitive files are now properly ignored
   - Safe to push to public repositories
   - Personal development files won't be accidentally committed

This cleanup ensures the repository follows industry standards, maintains professional presentation, and can be safely shared without exposing personal information while properly acknowledging AI assistance.
