\begin{abstract}
This report presents the development of an iOS application for real-time prediction of Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) classes using smartphone accelerometer data. The app implements a Random Forest classifier trained on the WISDM Activity Recognition Dataset, achieving 100\% accuracy on training data while maintaining real-time performance on mobile devices. The system continuously classifies user activity into four categories: Sedentary (<1.5 METs), Light (1.5-3 METs), Moderate (3-6 METs), and Vigorous (>6 METs).

The solution features a dual-mode system with realistic dummy data for demonstration and live sensor data for actual usage. The Random Forest model uses 10 engineered features extracted from 5-second sliding windows of accelerometer data, with 50 decision trees optimized for mobile performance. The app includes comprehensive statistics views, activity timeline graphs, health recommendations, and trend analysis across multiple time scales.

Key contributions include a scientifically validated classification framework, a robust 10-feature extraction pipeline, and comprehensive user interface providing multi-scale activity analysis. The implementation demonstrates the feasibility of smartphone-based continuous MET prediction using ensemble machine learning methods.

\section{Introduction}

Physical activity monitoring has become increasingly important for public health assessment and chronic disease prevention. Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) values provide a standardized measure of energy expenditure during various activities, making them valuable for quantifying physical activity intensity \cite{ainsworth2011compendium}.

The ADAMMA Challenge 2025 requires the development of a mobile application capable of real-time MET class prediction using only smartphone accelerometer data. This presents several technical challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time processing constraints on mobile devices
    \item Variability in device placement and orientation
    \item Battery efficiency considerations
    \item User interface design for continuous monitoring
    \item Model accuracy across diverse activities and users
\end{itemize}

This report details our approach to building an iOS application that addresses these challenges while maintaining high prediction accuracy and user experience through the implementation of a scientifically validated Random Forest classifier.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a Random Forest classification model for real-time MET prediction from accelerometer data using the WISDM dataset
    \item Implement an iOS application with comprehensive activity tracking capabilities and scientific model validation
    \item Design an intuitive user interface with detailed statistics and trend analysis
    \item Create a dual-mode system supporting both dummy demonstration data and live sensor tracking
    \item Provide health recommendations based on WHO physical activity guidelines
    \item Achieve high classification accuracy while maintaining real-time mobile performance
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{MET Classification Framework}

The MET classification system divides physical activities into four distinct categories based on energy expenditure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sedentary (<1.5 METs):} Sitting, lying down, minimal movement
    \item \textbf{Light (1.5-3 METs):} Slow walking, light household tasks
    \item \textbf{Moderate (3-6 METs):} Brisk walking, casual cycling
    \item \textbf{Vigorous (>6 METs):} Running, intense exercise, fast cycling
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Activity Recognition Using Accelerometers}

Previous research has demonstrated the feasibility of activity recognition using smartphone sensors \cite{kwapisz2011activity, ronao2016human}. Traditional approaches have focused on discrete activity classification, while our work extends this to continuous MET prediction using ensemble methods.

\subsection{Mobile Health Applications}

The proliferation of smartphones has enabled widespread deployment of health monitoring applications \cite{fawcett2020physical}. However, most existing solutions rely on external servers for processing, limiting real-time capabilities and raising privacy concerns.

\subsection{Energy Expenditure Estimation}

Several studies have explored energy expenditure estimation using wearable devices \cite{ellis2014hip, crouter2013refined}. Our approach adapts these methodologies for smartphone-based monitoring with simplified sensor requirements while maintaining scientific rigor through WISDM dataset training.

\section{Data \& Model Foundation}

\subsection{WISDM Dataset Description}

Our model is trained on the WISDM Activity Recognition Dataset \cite{kwapisz2011activity}, which contains accelerometer data from 51 subjects performing 18 diverse activities. The WISDM dataset provides comprehensive activity coverage including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ambulation Activities:} Walking, jogging, stairs (directly relevant to MET prediction)

    \caption{WISDM Dataset Overview: Activity distribution and MET class mapping used for model training}
    \label{fig:dataset_overview}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Processing Pipeline}

The real-time data processing pipeline consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Acquisition:} Accelerometer data collected at 20Hz sampling rate (WISDM standard)
    \item \textbf{Windowing:} Sliding window approach (window size: 5 seconds, 100 samples)
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction:} 10-feature computation including magnitude and axis-specific statistics
    \item \textbf{Normalization:} Z-score normalization using WISDM training dataset statistics
    \item \textbf{Classification:} Random Forest prediction with ensemble voting
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Swift, caption=iOS Data Processing Implementation]
func processAccelerometerData(_ data: (x: Double, y: Double, z: Double)) {
    // Add to sliding window buffer
    accelerometerData.append(data)
    
    // Maintain 5-second window (100 samples at 20Hz)
    if accelerometerData.count > 100 {
        accelerometerData.removeFirst()
    }
    
    // Extract features when window is full
    if accelerometerData.count == 100 {
        let features = MLFeatureExtractor.extractFeatures(from: accelerometerData)
        let prediction = RandomForestMETPredictor.predict(features: features)
        
        // Update UI with new prediction
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.currentActivity = prediction
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Feature Engineering}

\subsection{WISDM-Compatible Feature Extraction}

Our Random Forest approach uses a comprehensive 10-feature extraction pipeline compatible with the WISDM Activity Recognition Dataset methodology:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Magnitude Features:} Mean, standard deviation, maximum, and range of acceleration magnitude
    \item \textbf{Axis-Specific Features:} Mean and standard deviation for X, Y, and Z accelerometer axes
    \item \textbf{Temporal Context:} 5-second sliding windows (100 samples at 20Hz) for stable feature computation
    \item \textbf{Real-time Processing:} Efficient feature computation optimized for mobile performance
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Feature Set Details}

The 10 engineered features provide comprehensive activity characterization:

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Feature Extraction Pipeline}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Purpose} \\
        \midrule
        mag\_mean & Average acceleration magnitude & Overall activity intensity \\
        mag\_std & Standard deviation of magnitude & Variability in movement \\
        mag\_max & Peak acceleration magnitude & Vigorous activity detection \\
        mag\_range & Difference between max and min & Movement amplitude \\
        x\_mean & X-axis average acceleration & Device orientation effects \\
        x\_std & X-axis standard deviation & Horizontal movement patterns \\
        y\_mean & Y-axis average acceleration & Vertical orientation \\
        y\_std & Y-axis standard deviation & Vertical movement patterns \\
        z\_mean & Z-axis average acceleration & Forward/backward orientation \\
        z\_std & Z-axis standard deviation & Directional movement \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:features}
\end{table}

\subsection{Feature Computation}

The classification system computes features from accelerometer data using the following mathematical framework:

\begin{equation}
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Feature}_{normalized} = \frac{\text{Feature} - \mu_{train}}{\sigma_{train}}
\end{equation}

where $\mu_{train}$ and $\sigma_{train}$ are the mean and standard deviation from WISDM training data, ensuring consistent feature scaling across different devices and users.
